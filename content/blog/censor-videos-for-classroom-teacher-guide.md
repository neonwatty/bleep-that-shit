Teachers know the struggle: you find the perfect documentary, TED Talk, or YouTube video for your lesson plan, but there's one problem—a few inappropriate words make it unsuitable for your students. Rather than abandoning great educational content, you can quickly censor those words yourself. This guide shows educators how to make any video classroom-appropriate in minutes.

## The Challenge: Great Content, Inappropriate Language

Educational videos often contain valuable content that's almost perfect for classroom use:

- **Documentaries** covering history, science, or social issues may include quotes with profanity
- **YouTube educational content** from creators who don't filter their language
- **News clips and interviews** with unscripted moments
- **TED Talks and lectures** with occasional strong language
- **Film clips** that illustrate literary or historical themes
- **Primary source recordings** from historical events

Traditionally, teachers had two options: skip the video entirely or spend hours in complex video editing software. Neither is practical when you're preparing lessons for multiple classes.

## Why Browser-Based Video Censoring Works for Teachers

Bleep That Sh\*t! solves this problem with a free, browser-based tool designed for quick edits:

### No Software Installation Required

School computers often have restrictions on installing software. Our tool runs entirely in your browser—no downloads, no IT requests, no administrator permissions needed. Works on Chromebooks, Windows PCs, Macs, and tablets.

### Complete Privacy for Student Data

When editing videos that might contain student names or faces, privacy matters. Unlike cloud-based video editors, our tool processes everything locally on your device. **Your videos never upload to any server.** This helps maintain FERPA compliance and protects student privacy.

### Fast Enough for Lesson Prep

Teachers don't have hours to spend on video editing. Our AI-powered transcription identifies words automatically, letting you censor a 10-minute video in just 2-3 minutes.

### Free for Educators

No subscription fees, no premium tiers, no limits on video length. The tool is completely free for all users, including teachers and educational institutions.

## Step-by-Step Guide for Classroom Video Editing

### Step 1: Upload Your Video

Drag and drop your MP4 video file directly into the browser. The file stays on your computer throughout the entire process.

**Supported formats:**

- MP4 video files (most common for downloaded content)
- MP3 audio files (for podcasts or audio-only content)

### Step 2: Generate an Automatic Transcript

Select your transcription model and click "Transcribe." The AI will:

- Convert speech to text automatically
- Identify individual words with precise timestamps
- Work with multiple languages and accents

**Tip for educators:** Start with the "Tiny" model for most classroom videos—it's fast and handles clear speech well. Use larger models only if you have heavily accented speakers or poor audio quality.

### Step 3: Select Words to Censor

You have several options for identifying inappropriate content:

#### Quick Word Lists

Apply pre-built profanity lists with one click. This catches common inappropriate words automatically, saving you the time of manually reviewing the entire transcript.

#### Create Custom Word Lists for Your Classroom

One of the most powerful features for educators is the ability to **create and save custom word lists**. This is especially valuable when you:

- Work with content that uses the same problematic words repeatedly
- Need to censor specific terms for different grade levels
- Want to prepare multiple videos for the same unit or lesson
- Share resources with other teachers in your department

**How to create a custom word list:**

1. Click "Manage Word Lists" in the Word Lists tab
2. Create a new list with a descriptive name (e.g., "Middle School History" or "Science Documentary Terms")
3. Add words you commonly need to censor
4. Save the list—it's stored in your browser and available for all future videos

**Word lists are saved locally in your browser**, so they persist between sessions. Create lists once and reuse them throughout the school year. This is perfect for teachers who regularly show educational videos and want a consistent, quick workflow.

**Tip:** Create grade-level-specific lists. What's appropriate for high school seniors might not be suitable for middle schoolers. Having separate lists lets you quickly apply the right filter for each class.

#### Manual Selection

Click directly on words in the transcript to mark them for censoring. This gives you precise control—useful when context matters (the same word might be fine in one sentence but inappropriate in another).

#### Pattern Matching

Enter specific words to find and censor throughout the video:

- **Exact match**: Catches only that specific word
- **Partial match**: Catches variations (e.g., entering "damn" also catches "dammit")
- **Fuzzy match**: Catches similar-sounding words, helpful for catching variations the AI might have transcribed differently

### Step 4: Preview and Download

Choose your bleep sound (the classic TV censor tone works well for classroom settings), preview the censored sections, and download your edited video. The original video file remains unchanged.
