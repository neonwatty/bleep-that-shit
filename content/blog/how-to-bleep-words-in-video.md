Whether you're creating content for YouTube, editing a podcast, or preparing a video for work, there are times when you need to bleep out certain words. This guide will show you how to do it quickly and easily, right in your browser.

## Why Bleep Words in Videos?

There are many reasons you might need to censor audio in your videos:

- **Ad-friendly content**: Keep your videos monetizable on YouTube by removing profanity
- **Professional settings**: Prepare clips for presentations or corporate use
- **Family-friendly edits**: Create clean versions of content for all audiences
- **Comedy effect**: Sometimes a well-placed bleep is funnier than the actual word!

## The Traditional Way (And Why It's Painful)

Traditionally, bleeping words in video requires:

1. Importing the video into professional editing software
2. Finding each instance of the word you want to censor
3. Manually cutting the audio and inserting a bleep sound
4. Re-exporting the entire video

This process can take hours for a single video, especially if you're not experienced with video editing software.

## The Easy Way: Bleep That Sh\*t!

With Bleep That Sh\*t!, the process is much simpler:

### Step 1: Upload Your Video

Simply drag and drop your MP4 video file (or MP3 audio) into the browser. Your file never leaves your device - all processing happens locally.

### Step 2: Transcribe

Choose a Whisper AI model and click "Transcribe". The AI will automatically generate a word-level transcript of your audio, including precise timestamps for each word.

### Step 3: Select Words to Bleep

We provide four powerful ways to select which words to censor:

#### Word Lists

Apply pre-built or custom word lists with one click. Perfect for common profanity or creating reusable lists for your content.

#### Pattern Match

Enter words manually with three matching modes:

- **Exact match**: Bleep only exact matches of a word
- **Partial match**: Bleep words containing a specific string
- **Fuzzy match**: Bleep words that sound similar (great for catching variations)

#### Transcript View

Click directly on words in the transcript to toggle them for censoring. Matched words appear highlighted in pink.

#### Timeline

Visualize your audio and select precise time ranges to censor - useful for bleeping entire sections or sounds that aren't words.

### Step 4: Choose Your Bleep Sound

Pick from our selection of bleep sounds:

- **Classic Bleep**: The traditional TV censor tone
- **Brown Noise**: A softer, less jarring alternative
- **Dolphin Sounds**: For a comedic touch
- **T-Rex Roar**: When you want to make a statement!

Adjust the volume and buffer settings, preview your changes, then download your censored video.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use a quality audio source**: Clearer audio leads to better transcription
2. **Start with the Tiny model**: It's fast and accurate for most content
3. **Try different match modes**: Fuzzy matching can catch words the exact match might miss
4. **Adjust the bleep buffer**: Add a small buffer before and after words for cleaner censoring

## Privacy First

Unlike online video editors that upload your files to remote servers, Bleep That Sh\*t! processes everything in your browser. Your videos never leave your device, so you can censor sensitive content with complete peace of mind.
