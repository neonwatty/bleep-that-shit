Need to bleep audio online? Most "free" tools require downloads, accounts, or upload your files to their servers. Here's a tool that runs entirely in your browser - your video never leaves your device.

## Why Browser-Based Matters

### Complete Privacy

Traditional online video editors upload your files to remote servers for processing. That means:

- Your content sits on someone else's computer
- Potential data breaches expose your videos
- Terms of service may allow them to use your content
- Sensitive or confidential material at risk

Our tool processes everything locally using your browser's built-in capabilities. **Your video stays on your device from upload to download.** Nothing goes to any server.

### Works Anywhere

No Windows-only software. No Mac apps. If you have a modern browser, you can censor audio:

- **Desktop**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Tablet**: iPad Safari, Android Chrome
- **Phone**: Mobile browsers on iOS and Android
- **Chromebook**: Full functionality in Chrome

### Nothing to Install

No app downloads. No plugins. No "just install this helper utility." Open the page and start bleeping.

## How to Censor Audio Online

### Step 1: Upload Your File

Drag and drop your MP4 video or MP3 audio file. Supports files up to 10 minutes.

### Step 2: Generate Transcript

Click "Transcribe" and AI creates a word-by-word transcript. You'll see every word with its exact timestamp.

### Step 3: Select Words to Bleep

Three ways to choose what gets censored:

**Word Lists** - Apply pre-built profanity filters or create your own custom lists.

**Pattern Matching** - Enter words to find with exact, partial, or fuzzy matching.

### Step 4: Choose Sound and Download

Pick your bleep sound - classic TV tone, brown noise, or fun alternatives. Preview, then download your censored file.

## What Can You Censor?

### Video Files (MP4)

### Audio Files (MP3)

Upload audio-only files for podcasts, voice recordings, or music.

### Common Use Cases

- **Content creators**: Make videos ad-friendly for YouTube, TikTok
- **Teachers**: Clean up educational videos for classroom use
- **Businesses**: Prepare clips for professional presentations
- **Podcasters**: Remove profanity from interview recordings
- **Parents**: Create family-friendly versions of content

## The Technology Behind It

Our tool uses WebAssembly to run powerful audio processing directly in your browser:

- **Whisper AI** transcribes speech with word-level accuracy
- **FFmpeg** handles video/audio processing
- **Web Audio API** generates and inserts bleep sounds

These technologies run client-side, which is why your files never need to leave your device.
