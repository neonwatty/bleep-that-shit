Want to create a clean version of a video? Whether you're making content family-friendly, preparing media for a presentation, or creating a "radio edit" style version, our free AI tool makes it simple. No manual scrubbing through footage - AI finds the words for you.

## What Is a Clean Version?

A clean version is a copy of audio or video content with profanity and explicit language removed or bleeped. Think:

- **Radio edits** of songs with curse words removed
- **TV broadcasts** with bleeps over profanity
- **Family-friendly cuts** of movies
- **Workplace-appropriate** versions of podcasts

Traditionally, creating clean versions required expensive software and hours of manual editing. Now AI can do it in minutes.

## How to Make a Clean Version

### Step 1: Upload Your Video

Drag and drop your MP4 video or MP3 audio into the browser. Your file stays on your device - nothing uploads to any server.

### Step 2: AI Transcription

Click "Transcribe" and Whisper AI generates a complete word-by-word transcript with precise timestamps. Every word in your video is identified and timestamped.

### Step 3: Apply Profanity Filter

Use our built-in word lists to automatically catch common profanity:

Or review the transcript manually and click specific words to censor:

### Step 4: Choose Your Censoring Style

Pick how you want explicit content handled:

- **Classic bleep** - the traditional TV censor tone
- **Brown noise** - a softer, less jarring alternative
- **Silence** - just mute the word entirely
- **Fun sounds** - dolphin chirps, T-Rex roars for comedic effect

### Step 5: Download Your Clean Version

Preview your edits, then download. You get a clean MP4 (or MP3) ready to share.

## Use Cases for Clean Versions

### Family Movie Night

Found a great documentary or video essay, but it has a few F-bombs? Create a quick clean version before watching with kids.

### Classroom Content

Teachers regularly need to show videos that are 99% appropriate except for a few words. Clean them up in minutes instead of searching for alternatives.

### Corporate Presentations

That perfect TED Talk or industry interview has one inappropriate joke? Make it boardroom-ready.

### Podcast Repurposing

Turn explicit podcast episodes into clean versions for different platforms or audiences.

### Social Media Compliance

Platforms like TikTok and YouTube penalize profanity. Create clean versions to maximize reach and monetization.

## AI vs Manual: Why This Works Better

### Manual Method (Old Way)

1. Watch entire video, noting timestamps of every profanity
2. Import into video editor
3. Split audio track at each timestamp
4. Delete or mute each segment
5. Import bleep sound effect
6. Position bleep at each cut point
7. Export and hope you didn't miss anything

**Time required**: 30-60 minutes per video

### AI-Powered Method (Our Tool)

1. Upload video
2. Click "Transcribe"
3. Apply word list or click words
4. Download clean version

**Time required**: 2-5 minutes per video

The AI doesn't just save time - it catches words you might miss on manual review. Fuzzy matching even finds variations and similar-sounding words.

## Create Custom Word Lists

Beyond standard profanity, you might need to censor:

- **Industry-specific terms** inappropriate for certain audiences
- **Names or personal information** in interviews
- **Slurs or hate speech** the default lists might miss
- **Inside jokes** that don't translate to wider audiences

Create and save custom word lists, then apply them to future videos with one click.

## Privacy: Your Content Stays Yours

Unlike cloud-based video editors, our tool runs entirely in your browser. Your video:

- Never uploads to any server
- Isn't stored anywhere but your device
- Can't be accessed by us or anyone else

This matters when creating clean versions of content you don't own - you're not distributing copies to third parties.
