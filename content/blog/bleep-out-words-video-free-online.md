Need to censor profanity for YouTube monetization, work presentations, or repurposing content across platforms? **Bleep That Sh\*t** does it in your browser—no software to download, no account required.

## How It Works

### 1. Upload Your Video

Drag and drop any video file (MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM). Everything processes locally in your browser—your files never leave your device.

### 2. Select Words to Bleep

**Auto-detection:** Click "Transcribe" and Whisper AI generates a complete transcript with timestamps. Apply profanity word lists or use pattern matching to auto-select words.

**Manual selection:** Click words directly in the transcript to toggle them for bleeping.

**Timeline selection:** Select specific time ranges for non-word sounds or precise control.

### 3. Choose Your Bleep Sound

- **Classic bleep** — the iconic TV censor tone
- **Silence** — mutes without drawing attention
- **Fun sounds** — dolphin chirps, T-Rex roar

Adjust volume and buffer time as needed.

### 4. Export

Click "Apply Bleeps" and download. No watermark, original quality preserved.
