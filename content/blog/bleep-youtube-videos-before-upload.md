You've spent hours creating great content, but one slip of the tongue can cost you ad revenue. YouTube's ad-friendly content guidelines are strict about profanity, and even a single uncensored word can limit your monetization. Here's how to protect your revenue by bleeping profanity before you upload.

## YouTube's Ad-Friendly Content Guidelines

YouTube categorizes content into three monetization tiers based on language:

- **Full monetization**: No profanity, or very mild language used sparingly
- **Limited ads**: Moderate profanity or strong language used occasionally
- **No ads**: Heavy use of profanity, especially in the first 30 seconds

The **first 30 seconds are critical**. YouTube's algorithm pays special attention to the opening of your video. Profanity here has a bigger impact on your monetization status than the same word later in the video.

Words that can trigger limited or no monetization include obvious profanity, but also some words you might not expect. When in doubt, bleep it out.

## How to Bleep Your Video Before Upload

With Bleep That Sh\*t!, you can censor your video in minutes—right in your browser, no expensive software required.

### Step 1: Upload Your Video

Drag and drop your MP4 file into the browser. Your video stays on your device—nothing is uploaded to any server.

### Step 2: AI Transcription Finds Every Word

Select a transcription model and click "Transcribe." The AI generates a word-level transcript with precise timestamps, so you can see exactly where every word appears.

### Step 3: Select Words to Censor

You have multiple options:

**Use Word Lists**: Apply pre-built profanity lists with one click. This catches common words automatically.

## Pro Tips for Monetization

**Create a custom word list for your content style.** If you're a gaming creator, you might have different words to catch than a vlogger. Save your list and reuse it for every video.

**Check the first 30 seconds carefully.** This is where YouTube's algorithm focuses. Make sure your intro is clean.

**Use the preview feature.** Listen to your bleeps before downloading to ensure they sound natural and don't cut off important audio.

**Process before upload, not after.** It's much easier to upload a clean video than to replace one that's already been flagged for limited monetization.
