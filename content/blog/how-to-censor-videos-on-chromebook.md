Need to censor a video on your Chromebook? Most video editing software won't run on Chrome OS - no Premiere, no Final Cut, no iMovie. Here's a free tool that works directly in your browser.

## Why Video Editing on Chromebook Is Hard

Chromebooks can't run traditional desktop software:

- **Adobe Premiere Pro** - Windows/Mac only
- **iMovie** - Mac/iOS only
- **DaVinci Resolve** - Won't install on Chrome OS
- **Most Android apps** - Crash or work poorly

If you're on a **school-managed Chromebook**, you probably can't install apps at all.

## The Browser-Based Solution

Our [free video bleeping tool](/bleep) runs entirely in Chrome. No installation, no app store, no IT approval needed.

**Works on any Chromebook** because it's just a website.

## How to Bleep Words on Chromebook

### 1. Upload Your Video

Go to our [bleeping tool](/bleep) and drag in your MP4 or MP3 file. Your file stays on your device - nothing uploads to any server.

### 2. Transcribe

Click "Transcribe" and AI generates a word-by-word transcript. Use the **Tiny model** for faster processing on Chromebooks.

### 3. Select Words to Censor

**Quick way:** Apply a word list to catch all common profanity instantly.
