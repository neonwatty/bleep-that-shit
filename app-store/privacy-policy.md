# Privacy Policy for Bleep That

**Last Updated:** January 2026

## Overview

Bleep That ("we", "our", or "the app") is a video and audio censoring tool. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect and how we use it.

## The Short Version

- **Your videos and audio files are never uploaded** - all processing happens locally on your device
- **We don't see, access, or store your content** - your files stay on your device
- **We collect anonymous usage analytics** to improve the app
- **We don't sell your data** to anyone

## Data We DON'T Collect

- Your videos, audio files, or any media content
- Transcriptions of your audio
- Words you choose to censor
- Your personal files or photos
- Your name, email, or contact information (unless you voluntarily provide it)

## How Your Content is Processed

All video and audio processing happens **entirely on your device**:

1. When you upload a file, it stays in your device's memory
2. Audio transcription runs locally using on-device AI (Whisper)
3. Bleep sounds are applied locally
4. The censored file is created on your device
5. Nothing is ever sent to our servers

This means your content remains completely private. We have no ability to see, access, or recover any media you process with the app.
