# bleep that sh*t

Make anyone sound naughty / funny with Python.

Bleep out keywords of your choice from an mp4 by leveraging a transcription model (here Whisper) to transcribe the audio, then target and replace chosen words with *bleep* sounds using the extracted timestamps associated with your chosen word(s).  

All processing is performed locally - see the streamlit app (setup below) and detailed walkthrough notebook (see `beep_that_sht_walkthrough.ipynb`) to play / see nitty gritty details.  Click [![HuggingFace Space](https://img.shields.io/badge/ðŸ¤—-HuggingFace%20Space-cyan.svg)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/neonwatty/bleep_that_sht) to try out this toy app directly in your browser.  WARNING: the machine this Space is running on is pretty small - so use it to try out shorter (<2min) videos.

Some examples of the end product (make sure to turn volume on, its off by default).

Let's look more closely at the last example above - below is a short clip we'll bleep out some words from using the pipeline in this repo.  (make sure to turn on audio - its off by default)

Now the same clip with the words - "treetz", "ice", "cream", "chocolate", "syrup", and "cookie" - bleeped out

## Install instructions

To get setup to run the notebook / bleep your own videos / run the strealit demo first install the requirements for this project by pasting the below in your terminal.

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will need [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed on your machine as well.



## Instructions for bleeping **youtube** videos via youtube / shorts url

Start this streamlit demo locally that lets you enter in a youtube / shorts url to a video you wish to bleep

```python
python -m streamlit run bleep_that_sht/app_url_download.py
```

Alternatively you can start a gradio server with the same functionality

```python
python -m bleep_that_sht/gradio_app_url_download.py
```

This is the version hosted in the HF space [![HuggingFace Space](https://img.shields.io/badge/ðŸ¤—-HuggingFace%20Space-cyan.svg)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/neonwatty/bleep_that_sht).



## Instructions for bleeping your own **local** videos

Start this streamlit demo locally that lets you drag and drop local video files to bleep

```python
python -m streamlit run bleep_that_sht/app_video_upload.py
```
