# bleep that sh*t

Make anyone sound naughty with Python.

Bleep out keywords of your choice from an mp4 by leveraging a transcription model (here Whisper) to transcribe the audio, then target and replace chosen words with *bleep* sounds using the extracted timestamps associated with your chosen word(s).  

All processing is performed locally - see the streamlit app (setup below) and detailed walkthrough notebook (see `beep_that_sht_walkthrough.ipynb`) to play / see nitty gritty details.  Click [![HuggingFace Space](https://img.shields.io/badge/ðŸ¤—-HuggingFace%20Space-cyan.svg)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/neonwatty/bleep_that_sht) to try out this toy app directly in your browser.  WARNING: the machine this Space is running on is pretty small - so use it to try out shorter (<2min) videos.

An example - below is a short clip we'll bleep out some words from using the pipeline in this repo.  (make sure to turn on audio - its off by default)

Now the same clip with the words - "treetz", "ice", "cream", "chocolate", "syrup", and "cookie" - bleeped out
