# Bleep That Sh\*t! â€” In-Browser Audio & Video Censorship Tool

> **Note:** This README describes the latest version of Bleep That Sh\*t! â€” a 100% browser-based, privacy-first web app. For the legacy Python/Streamlit version, see the [Legacy Branch](https://github.com/neonwatty/bleep_that_sht/tree/legacy).

Make someone sound naughty ðŸ˜ˆ or make your content more Ad-friendly.

**Bleep That Sh\*t!** lets you instantly transcribe and censor words in your audio or video files, with full control over what gets bleeped. No uploads, no servers, no installs â€” everything happens right in your browser.

---

## How it works

1. **Upload** your audio (MP3) or video (MP4) file.
2. **Transcribe** using Whisper ONNX models (transformers.js) â€” all in-browser.
3. **Censor**: Pick words to bleep (exact, partial, or fuzzy match).
4. **Preview & Download**: Hear the result and save your censored file.

All processing is done locally in your browser using cutting-edge technologies. Your media and transcripts stay private â€” nothing is sent to a server unless you opt in.

## Technology Highlights

- **Rails 8 + Vite + Vanilla JS**: Modern, responsive web app with step-by-step UX
- **transformers.js + ONNX Whisper**: In-browser speech-to-text with word-level timestamps
- **ffmpeg.wasm**: Audio/video extraction and muxing, all in-browser
- **Web Audio API**: Precise audio editing and bleep insertion
- **Plyr**: Beautiful, interactive media playback
- **No Python, Docker, or ffmpeg install required**
- **No server/cloud processing by default** â€” privacy-first, local-only by design

## Examples

Some examples of the end product (make sure to turn volume on, its off by default).

Let's look more closely at the last example above - below is a short clip we'll bleep out some words from using the pipeline in this repo. (make sure to turn on audio - its off by default)

Now the same clip with the words - "treetz", "ice", "cream", "chocolate", "syrup", and "cookie" - bleeped out

## Using the App

Just open the app in any modern browser â€” **no installation or setup required**.

- Upload your file, follow the step-by-step workflow, and download your censored result

---

## App Walkthrough

The app guides you through:

- Uploading audio or video
- Selecting language and model
- Transcribing to generate a word-level transcript
- Entering words and matching modes (exact, partial, fuzzy)
- Running matching to find words to censor
- Choosing a bleep sound
- Previewing and downloading the censored result

The UI is modern, privacy-first, and works on desktop and mobile.

## Running Locally with Docker Compose

You can run the app locally using Docker Compose. This will build and start the app in a containerized environment, making it easy to test or develop without installing dependencies directly on your machine.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/neonwatty/bleep_that_sht.git
   cd bleep_that_sht
   ```
2. Start the app with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```
3. Visit [](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

The app will be available at `localhost:3000` by default. You can stop the app with `Ctrl+C` and remove containers with `docker compose down`.
