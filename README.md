# bleep that sh\*t

Make anyone sound naughty / funny with Python.

Bleep out keywords of your choice from an mp4 by leveraging a transcription model (here Whisper) to transcribe the audio, then target and replace chosen words with _bleep_ sounds using the extracted timestamps associated with your chosen word(s).

All processing is performed locally.

## Examples

Some examples of the end product (make sure to turn volume on, its off by default).

Let's look more closely at the last example above - below is a short clip we'll bleep out some words from using the pipeline in this repo. (make sure to turn on audio - its off by default)

Now the same clip with the words - "treetz", "ice", "cream", "chocolate", "syrup", and "cookie" - bleeped out

## Installation

### For local videos

To get setup to run the notebook / bleep your own videos / run the strealit demo first install the requirements for this project by pasting the below in your terminal.

```python
pip install -r requirements.streamlit
```

To install requirements for the gradio demo use this install

```python
pip install -r requirements.gradio
```

You will need [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed on your machine as well.

### For Youtube videos

Start this streamlit demo locally that lets you enter in a youtube / shorts url to a video you wish to bleep

```python
python -m streamlit run bleep_that_sht/app_url_download.py
```

Alternatively you can start a gradio server with the same functionality

```python
python -m bleep_that_sht/gradio_app_url_download.py
```

You can also use docker compose

```bash
docker compose up
```
